# Fanshawe CSS3 Course Work

Course work for the CSS3 class at Fanshawe College. The repository will be split by week where all course and assignment files will be found.

## Weekly Breakdown

Week 2 - Introduction to Selectors and Advanced Selectors

Week 2 assignment uploaded form_nostyle.html and form_style.css - March 16/2019
Note: I was unsure if the code for scaling to mobile devices was intended to me a media query or to be applied to the stylesheet in all views. I also wasnt clear on the marking required/optional fields using the, 
"Use the “status error” and “status information” styles from the lecture notes to help with the required and information fields" 

```
fieldset {
  border: 0;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```
